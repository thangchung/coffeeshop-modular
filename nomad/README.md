Then waiting until you see `coffeeshop-backend` and `coffeeshop-frontend` become `healthy`

Check status of workload and networking at [`http://localhost:4646/`](http://localhost:4646/)

Finally, go to [`http://localhost:5000`](http://localhost:5000) to test it

Notes:
- `Nomad` run inside WSL2 on Windows 11 => you can use Linux container (Docker for Desktop on Windows 11)
- Make sure no process occupied port `4646` on host (Windows 11)
  - List out by using `netstat -ano | findstr :4646`
  - Kill process by it id by using `taskkill /PID <id> /F`
- nomad version: `Nomad v1.2.8 (885a03085ecc7357de4cb0b8ad1804f0532fc756)` => version 1.3.1 have got an error, I don't know why
- Start nomad in WSL2: `sudo nomad agent -dev -bind 0.0.0.0 -log-level INFO`
